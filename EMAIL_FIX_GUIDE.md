3. Click on the service

2. Add these variables one by one:

```
EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=testsprojects2025@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=ohnd vhta sqgc rted
FROM_EMAIL=Mock Interview Platform <testsprojects2025@gmail.com>
```

1. Click **Manual Deploy** button
2. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🔍 **How to Verify Fix:**
